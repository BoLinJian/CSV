The class source code is in the CSV folder and at a minimum you'll need one of the GPLv3 license
files and all h, c, hpp and cpp files from that folder and a compiler that supports C89, C++03 and
stdint.h (for uintmax_t). Include CSV.hpp in your source file. If you need an advanced feature only
available in libcsv you'll have to include csv.h as well.

If you have Visual Studio 2010+ you can add the project file CSV/CSV.vcxproj to your solution and
reference it in your application project (right-click application project > References > Add New) or
do not include the CSV project file in your solution and instead build the static library CSV.lib
using one of the solutions below and then manually add the lib to your project (Linker > Input >
Additional Dependencies).

Two solutions are included:

CSV.sln
-
This solution will build the CSV library and run the stress test.

Example/Example.sln
-
This solution will build the CSV library and run the example.

All Visual Studio project files reference the global property file Global.props which is in the same
directory as this file. The global property file is used to help maintain compatibility with
versions of Visual Studio > 2010 so that my projects which were created in VS2010 can be opened and
built in any later version using the appropriate toolset (eg Visual Studio 2012 should compile
project using its 2012 compiler) and without requiring the project to be upgraded. Everything should
just work without any intervention.

If you are building using Visual Studio 2013+ you may see a warning that ToolsVersion 4.0 is unknown
or missing. The warning is benign. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb383796.aspx
